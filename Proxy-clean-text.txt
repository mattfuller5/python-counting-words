Film being moved onto a mobile device:
problems:
Some of the long shots, in the movie, that are used will become harder to see as the screen that you will watch it on will be a lot smaller.
The sound an image will become a lot worse, compared to the cinema, when it is on the phone as the phone will not have the capabilities that you would have at a cinema with the sound and image.
In action scenes there is a lot of camera movement so the viewer would most likely have a worsened experience while watching this movie on their phone. 
The film will also have to be scaled so that it can fit on the phone screen meaning that they may have to use black bars on the top and bottom of the screen or zoom in on the screen and remove some of the content that would be on the outside of the screen.
